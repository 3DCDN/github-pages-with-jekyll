The whole idea started with the thought that makers should have some way of keeping track of the recipes used when 3D printing the models they have. The recipe or parameters
used may change and the app would be a good place to keep track of these changes. It can be frustrating at times to obtain a set of parameters that works for all model and 
geometry types. By using the history of a model, you can maintain a better track record and make better use of your time.
